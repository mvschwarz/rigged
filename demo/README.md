# North Star Demo

A complete multi-agent topology demonstrating Rigged's core capabilities.

This directory is the canonical authoring example for Rigged. It is meant to be
read by both humans and coding agents as the reference layout for a real rig:

- `rig.yaml` — the topology source of truth
- `culture.md` — rig-wide culture/guidance
- `agents/*/agent.yaml` — per-agent package manifests
- `scripts/` — baseline seeding, verification, and proof helpers

The same tree is also the golden source for same-checkout bundle tests:

```bash
rigged bundle create demo/rig.yaml --rig-root demo -o /tmp/demo.rigbundle
rigged bundle inspect /tmp/demo.rigbundle
rigged bundle install /tmp/demo.rigbundle --yes --target /tmp/demo-install
rigged up /tmp/demo.rigbundle
```

## Topology

- **orch** pod: `lead` (claude-code) — orchestrator
- **dev** pod: `impl` (claude-code), `qa` (codex), `design` (claude-code)
- **rev** pod: `r1` (claude-code), `r2` (codex)
- **infra** pod: `daemon` (terminal, monitoring), `ui` (terminal, cwd: packages/ui)
- Edges: `orch.lead` delegates to `dev.impl`, `dev.qa` observes `dev.impl`, `rev.r1` collaborates with `rev.r2`

8 nodes across 4 pods. 6 agent harnesses + 2 terminal infrastructure nodes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- tmux 3+
- Rigged built: `npm run build` from repo root
- Claude Code and/or Codex CLI installed

## Quick Start

```bash
./demo/run.sh
```

`run.sh` boots the topology and then establishes a restore-safe baseline for
the demo rig. If fresh runtime sessions are not yet resumable, it seeds one
warmup turn per agent and re-verifies native resume before handing control back.

## Resume Baseline

Before treating restore as trustworthy, establish and verify the runtime resume
baseline on a fresh boot:

```bash
npx tsx demo/scripts/check-demo-health.ts --rig demo-rig
npx tsx demo/scripts/verify-native-resume.ts --rig demo-rig
npx tsx demo/scripts/seed-resume-baseline.ts --rig demo-rig
npx tsx demo/scripts/verify-native-resume.ts --rig demo-rig
```

The baseline matters because Claude and Codex have different native resume
semantics. See `docs/planning/post-northstar-round/runtime-resume-semantics.md`
for the currently observed runtime caveats.

Current known-good rule on macOS:

- fresh Codex sessions in this demo are resumable immediately
- fresh Claude sessions are not snapshot-safe immediately after `rigged up`
- one completed warmup turn is enough to make the current stored Claude IDs
  resumable on this fixture

## Full Proof Package

```bash
./demo/run-proof.sh
```

This produces automated proof artifacts in `demo/proof/`:

| Artifact | Source | Type |
|----------|--------|------|
| `up-transcript.txt` | `rigged up demo/rig.yaml` output | Automatic |
| `ps-nodes.txt` | `rigged ps --nodes` after boot | Automatic |
| `health-after-boot.json` | `check-demo-health.ts` after boot | Automatic |
| `native-resume-after-boot.txt` | immediate native probe after boot | Automatic |
| `native-resume-after-boot.json` | immediate native probe machine output | Automatic |
| `seed-resume-baseline.txt` | baseline seeding summary | Automatic, only if seeding was needed |
| `seed-resume-baseline.json` | baseline seeding machine output | Automatic, only if seeding was needed |
| `native-resume-before-down.txt` | native Claude/Codex probe before down | Automatic |
| `native-resume-before-down.json` | native probe machine output | Automatic |
| `down-transcript.txt` | `rigged down` output | Automatic |
| `tmux-check.txt` | `tmux ls` after teardown | Automatic |
| `restore-transcript.txt` | `rigged restore <snapshotId> --rig <rigId>` output | Automatic |
| `ps-restored.txt` | `rigged ps --nodes` after restore | Automatic |
| `browser-screenshot.png` | Explorer + Graph + Detail Panel | **Manual** |
| `resume-test.txt` | Post-restore agent context check | **Manual** |

### Manual Steps

After `run-proof.sh` completes:

1. **Browser screenshot:** Open `http://localhost:5173` → screenshot showing Explorer with all pods, Graph with pod grouping, Node Detail Panel open. Save to `demo/proof/browser-screenshot.png`.

2. **Resume test:** Run `tmux attach -t orch-lead@demo-rig` → ask "What were you working on?" → copy response to `demo/proof/resume-test.txt`.

## Expected Session Names

After boot, `tmux list-sessions` should show:
```
orch-lead@demo-rig
dev-impl@demo-rig
dev-qa@demo-rig
dev-design@demo-rig
rev-r1@demo-rig
rev-r2@demo-rig
infra-daemon@demo-rig
infra-ui@demo-rig
```

## Expected Boot Time

6 harness launches + 2 terminal launches. Sequential (topological order). Expected total: 2-5 minutes depending on hardware.

## Restore Notes

- For exact proof and repeated local testing, prefer explicit restore:
  `rigged restore <snapshotId> --rig <rigId>`
- `rigged up demo-rig` is only safe as a restore shortcut while there is a
  single stopped historical rig with that name. Once multiple historical
  `demo-rig` instances exist, Rigged correctly returns an ambiguity error.
