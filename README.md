# OpenRig

Open source local control plane for coding-agent topologies.

Define your agent team in YAML. Boot it with one command. Claude Code and Codex in the same topology, managed as one system.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @openrig/cli

# Prepare the machine (attempts tmux, cmux, Claude Code, Codex, tmux defaults — reports what worked)
rig setup

# Boot the demo rig (3 pods, 8 nodes, mixed runtimes)
rig up demo

# Open the UI
rig ui open
```

After the demo boots, open the UI and click **orch1.lead** in the topology graph. Use **Open CMUX** to jump into a terminal for that node. If cmux is not available, use the tmux attach command shown in the node detail panel instead.

## What It Does

OpenRig manages the topology that coding agents form when you run them together. Not the agents themselves. The system they create: which sessions are running, how they relate, how to recover after a reboot, and how to stop it from becoming terminal sprawl.

- **Define** topologies in YAML (RigSpec) with pods, edges, and continuity policies
- **Boot** everything with `rig up` — tmux sessions, harnesses, startup files, readiness checks
- **See** the topology in a live graph with explorer, node detail, and system log
- **Discover** existing Claude Code and Codex sessions in tmux and adopt them into a managed rig
- **Snapshot** the full topology on `rig down`, restore by name with `rig up <name>`
- **Communicate** across agents with `rig send`, `rig broadcast`, and `rig chatroom`
- **Evolve** running topologies with `rig expand`, `rig shrink`, `rig launch`, `rig remove`

Every agent runs in a tmux session you can attach to, inspect, and work with directly.

## Demo Rig

OpenRig ships with a demo rig you can boot in seconds:

```bash
rig specs preview demo
```

```
demo (rig, pod_aware)
  Launch-grade starter: a stable full product squad with two
  orchestrators, implementation, QA, design, and two independent
  reviewers.

  Pod: orch1 (2 members)
    lead — claude-code
    peer — codex
  Pod: dev1 (3 members)
    impl — claude-code
    qa — codex
    design — claude-code
  Pod: rev1 (2 members)
    r1 — claude-code
    r2 — codex
```

Also ships: `implementation-pair`, `adversarial-review`, `research-team`, `product-team`, and `secrets-manager` (HashiCorp Vault managed by a specialist agent).

## How It Works

OpenRig is a local daemon + CLI + MCP server + React UI, built on tmux.

```
CLI / UI / MCP
      |
Hono HTTP daemon
      |
  Domain services (52)
      |
  SQLite + tmux + runtime adapters
```

- **CLI**: 40+ commands designed for both humans and agents. Every mutating command ends with what happened, current state, and next action.
- **UI**: Explorer sidebar, topology graph with pod grouping, node detail panel, system log, chatroom.
- **MCP**: 17 tools so agents can manage their own topology (`rig_up`, `rig_ps`, `rig_send`, `rig_chatroom_send`, etc.)
- **Runtimes**: Claude Code, Codex, and terminal nodes. Adapters for Pi and OpenHands in development.

## Key Concepts

- **RigSpec**: Declarative multi-agent topology in YAML. Pods, members, edges, continuity policies, culture file.
- **AgentSpec**: Reusable agent blueprint with skills, guidance, hooks, profiles, and startup contracts.
- **Pod**: Bounded context group. Agents in a pod share memory and can maintain each other's context.
- **Discovery**: `rig discover` fingerprints existing tmux sessions. `rig adopt` brings them under management.
- **Snapshot/Restore**: `rig down --snapshot` captures full state. `rig up <name>` restores from latest snapshot. Restore reports per-node outcomes (resumed, fresh, or failed).
- **RigBundle**: Portable archive with vendored AgentSpecs and SHA-256 integrity. Share topologies across machines.
- **Culture**: CULTURE.md sets coordination norms for the group. Research rigs get exploratory culture. Implementation rigs get conservative, trust-but-verify culture.

## Agent-Managed Software

A rig can package actual software alongside the agents that manage it. The shipped example is `secrets-manager`: a HashiCorp Vault instance operated by a specialist agent.

```bash
rig up secrets-manager
rig env status secrets-manager
rig send vault-specialist@secrets-manager "Check Vault health and report status." --verify
```

Requires Docker for service-backed rigs.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- tmux

Optional:
- cmux for `Open CMUX` node surface controls
- Docker for service-backed rigs and managed apps

## Setup and Troubleshooting

- `rig setup` attempts core machine preparation: tmux, cmux, Claude Code, Codex, and tmux defaults. It reports what it tried and what actually succeeded. If something fails, it gives the local agent enough context to finish the job.
- `rig setup --full` attempts a broader operator workstation setup (jq, gh) on top of core.
- `rig doctor` inspects current system health and helps diagnose problems after setup. Use it when something stops working or after machine changes.

Both commands support `--json` for agent-driven workflows.

Managed runtime boot (during `rig up`) may modify runtime config to reduce permission and MCP friction. `rig setup` discloses these paths so agents know what was changed:
- global Claude: `~/.claude/settings.json` for OpenRig command allowlisting
- global Claude state: `~/.claude.json` for managed workspace trust and onboarding completion
- project Claude: `.claude/settings.local.json` for managed-session permissions
- project Claude MCP: `.mcp.json` for OpenRig-managed MCP servers
- global Codex: `~/.codex/config.toml` for workspace trust and MCP servers

Already-running adopted sessions may need restart before they pick up newly written runtime config.

**For agents:** Ask the user whether they want core setup (`rig setup`) or the fuller workstation path (`rig setup --full`) before choosing the invocation. Inspect the result with `--json` and use `rig doctor` to finish any remaining machine-specific issues.

## Comparison with Claude Managed Agents

Anthropic shipped Claude Managed Agents — a cloud-hosted, Claude-only runtime at $0.08/session-hour. OpenRig is the local side: open source, cross-harness, runs on your machine, costs nothing.
